# mtbrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae for machine translation software.
Just run:

    $ brew tap query/mtbrew
    $ brew install moses  # or whatever you feel like

Note that some useful packages, such as `mecab` and `stanford-parser`,
are already present in the Homebrew base distribution, and are therefore
not included here.

These formulae are currently only tested on Mavericks.
Bug reports and other contributions are welcome!
